The planets equatorial clouds take 18 hours to complete one rotation. The
reason this happens is that Neptune does not have a solid body.

Triton is the largest moon of Neptune. It was probably named for the same
Roman demigod referenced in the Disney version of The Little Mermaid.

Neptune is the 8th planet. Eight is two cubed. 

Neptune is the god of the sea in Roman mythology
